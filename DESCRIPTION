Description: Did you always want to know how many times Captain Jean Luc
        Picard says: "Tea, Earl Grey, hot" ? Do you want to extract all the
        text that Geordi Laforge uses in the series? This is the ultimate solution.
        This is the ultimate The Next Generation dataset, with all the descriptions
        from the script, all the text spoken and includes names of the scenes, acts,
        and for your modeling pleasure, I have included IMDB ratings and ID's for
        every episode.
